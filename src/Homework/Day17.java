public class Day17 {
    //Task 1:
    // Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the reverse of the string.

    // 2:
    //Write a program that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

    //Task 3:
    //Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).


    //Task 4:
    //Write a program that counts the occurrences of a special characters in a given string.

    //       Task 5:
    // Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a valid password. A valid password should be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (-, _, &, !, @, #, $)

    // Task 6:
    //Write a program that takes two strings as input and concatenates them, removing duplicate characters.

    //Task 7:
    // Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a valid URL (starts with "http://" or "https://") has www and ends with .com or .org or .gov

    //Task 8:
    //Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the most repeated character in the string.
    //example -> javava => most repeated character is 'a' 3
    //Hint: can be done with nested loop



    //Note: For each task, you can use a combination of loops, if/switch statements
